<h3>So here is where we stand, based on your inputs you are making or loosing X month. Lets call this your "free cashflow."  If we take that amount and pay your highest interest debt that will have three great impacts on your finances<h3>

<ol>
  <li> Your debt balance comes down</li>
  <li> Your monthly interest payments get smaller</li>
  <li> Your credit score will likely improve</li>
</ol>
